# Research should be impactful, novel and exciting. What will you discover?

## Project 1: Identification of new immunotherapy targets
#### (mostly wet lab)
A set of new cancer therapies rely on the targeting of markers present at
the surface of cancer cells via the genetic engineering of cytotoxic
T cells (CAR-T) or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). While these treatments
work well for many patients with certain types of blood cancers, their
application in other cancer types is limited in part by the lack of
cancer-specific markers to target.

We and others observed a wide range of splicing variations occuring across
a wide array of tumor types (e.g. [Jha, Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02681-3)).
Building from the hypothesis that this transcriptomics diversity would 
make it possible to find cancer-specific splicing variations in surface
receptors, we developped a computational pipeline that surveys a large
array of normal tissues to identify candidate immunotherapy targets.

We currently focus our efforts on the experimental validation of
candidates that appear to be prime therapeutic targets
in acute myeloid leukemia.

## Project 2: Blood-specific RNA splicing regulation
#### (mostly wet lab)
Sets of alternative RNA splicing events are co-regulated to shape the
development and function of the nervous system. Several such programs and their
regulators have been extensively studied
(e.g. [Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2015](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/29/7/746)).
In addition to explaining important molecular mechanisms underlying the
complexity of the brain, these alternative splicing programs can be
involved in neuronal disorders and diseases (e.g.
[Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516308061?via%3Dihub)).

Similar to components of the nervous system, immune cells display
remarkable cellular, molecular and environmental diversity. We believe
that a part of this complexity is enabled by
hematopoietic-specific alternative splicing events. Our computational
analyses have highlighted a number of putative splicing regulators that
are specifically expressed in subsets of immune cell types.

We now aim to confirm the role of top candidates in the regulation
of splicing in immune cells and characterize the function of
dedicated hematopoietic splicing programs.

## Project 3: What is a gene?
#### (computational)
Here there is no supporting data, no rationale, just a question.
What is a gene?

This project is 100% computational. Details will be provided upon request.
