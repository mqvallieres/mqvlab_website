# Research should be impactful, novel and exciting. What will you discover?

## Project 1: Personalized cancer immunotherapy
A set of new cancer therapies rely on the targeting of markers present at
the surface of cancer cells using chimeric antigen receptor
T cells, antibody-drug conjugates or vaccines. While these treatments
work well for many patients with certain types of blood cancers, their
application in other cancer types is limited in part by the lack of
cancer-specific markers to target.

We and others observed a wide range of splicing variations occuring across
a wide array of tumor types
(e.g. [Jha, Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02681-3)).
We developped a computational pipeline that identifies
cancer-specific antigens originating from these splicing variations.

We currently focus our efforts on the experimental validation of
candidates that appear to be prime therapeutic targets
in high-risk cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia and pancreatic cancer.

## Project 2: Blood-specific RNA splicing regulation
Sets of alternative RNA splicing events are co-regulated to shape the
development and function of the nervous system. We previously studied
such programs and their regulators
(e.g. [Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2015](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/29/7/746)).
In addition to explaining important molecular mechanisms underlying the
complexity of the brain, these alternative splicing programs can be
involved in neuronal disorders and diseases (e.g.
[Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516308061?via%3Dihub)).

Similar to components of the nervous system, immune cells display
remarkable cellular, molecular and environmental diversity. We believe
that a part of this complexity is enabled by
hematopoietic-specific alternative splicing events. Our computational
analyses have highlighted a number of putative splicing regulators that
are specifically expressed in subsets of immune cell types.

We now aim to confirm the role of top candidates in the regulation
of splicing in immune cells and characterize the function of
dedicated hematopoietic splicing programs.

## Projects 3, 4 and beyond: What is a gene? What are the evolutionary drivers of gene regulation?
Sometimes we need to ask big questions. You might have some
of those questions yourself. Let's chat.

Supported projects will be mostly computational.
