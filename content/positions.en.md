### I want you to join me!
**We currently have no openings for grad students or interns for
the winter 2024. Postdoc applications might be considered.
New openings for grad students and postdocs are expected
in Spring or Summer 2024.**

Applicants seeking to conduct dry lab and/or experimental
work are welcome to apply. Depending on the project, applicants with
backgrounds in either molecular biology, cell biology,
genetics, RNA biology, immunology or bioinformatics could be a good fit.

Please state the **reason of your interest in the lab** and share your
**CV** and full **B.Sc. transcript** when
[reaching out](mailto:mathieu.quesnel-vallieres@usherbrooke.ca).

Graduate students will pursue a degree in Cell Biology at the [Master's](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/admission/programme/607/maitrise-en-biologie-cellulaire/)
or [Ph.D.](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/admission/programme/704/doctorat-en-biologie-cellulaire/) level.
Applicants must hold a B.Sc. in a related field
(e.g. biology, biochemistry, pharmacology,...) with a strong GPA
to be admitted to the program. Please note that courses at
the Universit√© de Sherbrooke are presented in French and that some knowledge
of the language is required.

### Lab philosophy
I strongly encourage an open and collaborative dynamic within the lab.
Group members are expected to engage with each other's projects and have good
communication skills.

The lab philosophy as well as general guidelines will be described in the lab
handbook, soon to be available here.
