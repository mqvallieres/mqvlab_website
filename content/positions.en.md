### I want you to join me!

Posted April 2025: [PhD project](https://github.com/mqvallieres/mqvlab_website/raw/master/static/phd_project.pdf)

**Graduate students, co-op students/interns
and postdoc candidates with a background
in genetics/biochemistry/transcriptomics
seeking to do experimental or computational work will be considered.**

<!--
Applicants seeking to conduct dry lab and/or experimental
work are welcome to apply. Depending on the project, applicants with
backgrounds in either molecular biology, cell biology,
genetics, RNA biology, immunology or bioinformatics could be a good fit.
-->

Important for co-op students: openings will not be posted on the
Trivio system. Please inquire about co-op internship opportunities
1-2 semesters ahead of your expected internship start date.

Please state  **why you are interested in the lab** and share your
**CV** and **transcripts** when
[reaching out](mailto:mathieu.quesnel-vallieres@usherbrooke.ca).

Graduate students will pursue a degree in Cell Biology at the [Master's](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/admission/programme/607/maitrise-en-biologie-cellulaire/)
or [Ph.D.](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/admission/programme/704/doctorat-en-biologie-cellulaire/) level.
Applicants must hold a B.Sc. in a related field
(e.g. biology, biochemistry, pharmacology,...) with a strong GPA
to be admitted to the program. Please note that courses at
the Universit√© de Sherbrooke are presented in French and that some knowledge
of the language is required.

### Lab philosophy
I strongly encourage an open and collaborative dynamic within the lab.
Group members are expected to engage with each other's projects and have good
communication skills.

handbook, available [here](https://github.com/mqvallieres/mqvlab_website/raw/master/static/MQVlab_guide.pdf)
