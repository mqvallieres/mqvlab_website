### Come work with us!

<!--
Posted April 2025: [PhD project](https://github.com/mqvallieres/mqvlab_website/raw/master/static/phd_project.pdf)

**Graduate students, co-op students/interns
and postdoc candidates with a background
in genetics/biochemistry/transcriptomics
seeking to do experimental or computational work will be considered.**
-->

We generally have one to two positions for grad students or postdocs available each year.
Applicants seeking to conduct computational and/or experimental
research are welcome to apply. Depending on the project, applicants with a
background in molecular biology, cell biology, cancer,
genetics, RNA biology, immunology or bioinformatics could be a good fit.

CO-OP STUDENTS: openings will not be posted on the
Trivio system. Please contact us to inquire about internship opportunities
two semesters ahead of your expected internship start date.

Please state  **why you are interested in the lab** and share your
**CV** and **transcripts** when
[reaching out](mailto:mathieu.quesnel-vallieres@usherbrooke.ca).

Graduate students will pursue a degree in [Cell Biology](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/dep-immunologie-biologie-cellulaire/programmes/biologie-cellulaire)
or [Immunology](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/dep-immunologie-biologie-cellulaire/programmes/immunologie)
at the Master's or Ph.D. level.
Applicants must hold a B.Sc. in a related field
(e.g. biology, biochemistry, pharmacology,...) with a strong GPA
to be admitted to the program. Please note that courses at
the Universit√© de Sherbrooke are given in French and that some knowledge
of the language is required. French classes are provided by the University.

### Lab philosophy
I strongly encourage an open and collaborative dynamic within the lab.
Group members are expected to engage with each other's projects and have good
communication skills.

The lab philosophy as well as general guidelines are described in the [lab
handbook](https://github.com/mqvallieres/mqvlab_website/raw/master/static/MQVlab_guide.pdf).
