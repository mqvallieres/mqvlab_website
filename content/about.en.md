### Mathieu Quesnel-Vallières, Ph.D.
he/him; last name pronunciation: *"ken-el val-e-air"*
#### Assistant Professor
#### Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Université de Sherbrooke
The list of biology fields that my research has involved at one point
or another is too long to post here. Let's say I know very little about
a lot of things.

**On the daily:**
If you wonder whether I'm being serious, I'm not. Music always and
everywhere. I sneeze often and loud - my apologies to those who spend
time in my general vicinity.

**About my job:**
Conferences are the best part of what we do as academic
researchers. You travel to meet new colleagues, start collaborations,
get updated on the state of the art, promote your work. It's the best.

**Training:**
- Postdoc, University of Pennsylvania (2023)
- Ph.D., University of Toronto (2017)
- M.Sc., Université de Montréal (2010)
- B.Sc., Université de Montréal (2007)

### Emma Delannoy
#### M.Sc. student in Cell Biology
During my academic journey, I have been able to explore numerous fields,
but I have primarily worked on projects related to the regulation
of the immune system in the context of cancer.

**On the daily:**
I am quite talkative, always chatting or humming a little tune.
As for hobbies, I am a fan of traditional elderly activities,
especially embroidery and crochet.

**About my job:**
What I appreciate the most is the opportunity to evolve in a multicultural
environment and to interact with people with different backgrounds and
perspectives, making this environment even more enriching and inspiring.

PS : hide your pens, I heard someone has a little hoarding problem...

### Nassima Bouzidi
#### M.Sc. student in Cell Biology
I previously had the opportunity to explore a multitude of projects,
primarily focused on gene therapy and neurobiology. I arrive in Sherbrooke
with the determination to concretize my professional aspirations by fully
investing myself in a project that is dear to my heart.

**On the daily:**
I can't help but dance, albeit poorly, every time I listen to music, and I listen
to a lot of it... I'm learning to understand the local language. You can often find
me with my notebook where I collect the Quebec expressions I hear for the first time.

**About my job:**
I love, and have always loved, working in research, a world where we have the
pleasure to interact daily with passionate collaborators from all corners of the world,
from whom we learn a lot about science and the world.

### Virginie Cyr
she/her
#### B.Sc. student in pharmacology

**On the daily:**
I am always ready for an activity, whether it's going for a work out,
swimming, or especially going out to eat.

**During my internship:**
As part of my first research internship, I am working on the analysis of alternative
splicing in genes crucial to hematopoiesis. What I love about research is primarily
the collaboration and spirit of mutual support. You can easily recognize me in the
lab... I always have a jacket with me. It's too cold in the office!

### Mathieu Desnoyers-Barbeau
il/lui
#### B.Sc. student in biotech engineering
For me, research represents the ultimate adventure for a learner; being constantly
exposed to the unknown and the new while asking questions. It's a perfect environment
for curious individuals like me. In research, my interests are numerous, but here are
the main ones: plant biology, biotechnologies (especially biomanufacturing), and programming.
My goal is to pursue a Master's and a PhD within my own business (entrepreneurial student project).

**On the daily:**
I discovered last year that I have a thirst for exploring the world. Every time the
opportunity arises, I jump on a plane. Otherwise, I take care of my plants and constantly
shop for cars. I'm also the lab member with useless gadgets, like a cup that I control
with my iPhone; though it's true that I do programming there, so I need to have some tech
stuff on my desk.

**During my internship:**
I am working on a project that is entirely carried out through programming. Therefore,
I am learning about the field of bioinformatics and enhancing my knowledge in biology,
programming, and genetic data processing. What I love about research in a university lab
is the lab life. Meeting other motivated and curious students like myself is stimulating
and truly enjoyable. Collaborative work is genuinely motivating.
