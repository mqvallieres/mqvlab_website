### Mathieu Quesnel-Vallières, Ph.D.
he/him; last name pronunciation: *"ken-el val-e-air"*
#### Assistant Professor
#### Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Université de Sherbrooke
The list of biology fields that my research has involved at one point
or another is too long to post here. Let's say I know very little about
a lot of things.

**On the daily:**
If you wonder whether I'm being serious, I'm not. Music always and
everywhere. I sneeze often and loud - my apologies to those who spend
time in my general vicinity.
Leadership style: 95% Gus Fring, 5% Michael Scott

**About my job:**
Conferences are the best part of what we do as academic
researchers. You travel to meet new colleagues, start collaborations,
get updated on the state of the art, promote your work. It's the best.

**Training:**
- Postdoc, University of Pennsylvania (2023)
- Ph.D., University of Toronto (2017)
- M.Sc., Université de Montréal (2010)
- B.Sc., Université de Montréal (2007)

### Emma Delannoy
#### Ph.D. Student in Cell Biology
During my academic journey, I have been able to explore numerous fields,
but I have primarily worked on projects related to the regulation
of the immune system in the context of cancer.

**On the daily:**
I am quite talkative, always chatting or humming a little tune.
As for hobbies, I am a fan of traditional elderly activities,
especially embroidery and crochet.

**About my job:**
What I appreciate the most is the opportunity to evolve in a multicultural
environment and to interact with people with different backgrounds and
perspectives, making this environment even more enriching and inspiring.

PS : hide your pens, I heard someone has a little hoarding problem...


![Nassima](/img/nassima_small.jpg "Nassima in the lab")

### Nassima Bouzidi
#### Ph.D. Student in Cell Biology
I previously had the opportunity to explore a multitude of projects,
primarily focused on gene therapy and neurobiology. I arrive in Sherbrooke
with the determination to concretize my professional aspirations by fully
investing myself in a project that is dear to my heart.

**On the daily:**
I can't help but dance, albeit poorly, every time I listen to music, and I listen
to a lot of it... I'm learning to understand the local language. You can often find
me with my notebook where I collect the Quebec expressions I hear for the first time.

**About my job:**
I love, and have always loved, working in research, a world where we have the
pleasure to interact daily with passionate collaborators from all corners of the world,
from whom we learn a lot about science and the world.


![Léo Eusebi](/img/leo1_small.jpg "Léo in the city")

### Léo Eusebi
#### M.Sc. student in Cell Biology

I originally started my academic career in biology due to my love for animals and plants
but eventually branched out towards bioinformatics and medicine. I discovered that as
long as there is a hint of biology in the field I’ll be able to find passion and
strength to fully throw myself in the topic. My master thesis revolved around colorectal
cancer and metabolic modelling. 

**On the daily:**
I am extremely curious and I love to dig into different kinds of hobbies such as
crochet, hiking, drawing, music, cooking, plant parenting, dance, gaming, etc.
(jack-of-all-trade pretty much, eh?). On a side note, I am also a homebody who loves
cats, although squirrels are starting to grow on me.

**About my job:**
I very much enjoy socialising with people from different backgrounds as I believe
such interactions always provide useful insights. Concerning my research, cancer
is something I find really fascinating and always crave to learn more about.

### Mikel Hurtado, Ph.D.
#### Postdoctoral researcher

From the beginning, I was interested in genetics, which led me to pursue a PhD in
forest genetics. During this time, I realized that bioinformatics would be my future
and the path I wanted to follow. Coming from the field of plant science, transitioning
into cancer research is very exciting. Especially because cancer has always been a
disease that has deeply intrigued me. I’m really keen to do my bit!

**On the daily:**
I’m someone who’s always up for any plan, especially if it means good company, good vibes,
and a few laughs. I love basketball, and I’m always looking to discover new places and
meet new people, so being here in Quebec is a great opportunity for both.

**About my work:**
What I like most about my work is that I’m constantly learning, it challenges me, and
lets me contribute to meaningful progress. I also enjoy the opportunity to share knowledge
and collaborate with other researchers.

### Tony-Carlo Blanchette
#### B.Eng. Student in Biotechnology Engineering

Passionate about mathematics from a young age, it was only two years ago that I 
turned to an even more exciting and promising field: biology. My immersion in bioinformatics
during this internship definitely gave me a new spark!

**On the daily:**
Always smiling and lively, except when I'm coding. Fun fact: I developed a real passion
for hospital gastronomy… except for liver with sausages…

**About my work:**
Newly introduced to the field of research, I find in this sector the opportunity
to contribute to advancing knowledge on cancer, leaving a mark through concrete
projects carried out in collaboration with multidisciplinary teams.

### Juan David Millan Lora
#### B.Eng. Student in Robotic Engineering

I have an eclectic background that leads me to explore both applied sciences and the humanities.
My interest always goes toward anything that helps better understand how the body,
the mind, and technology work.

**On the daily:**
I am disciplined and passionate about learning, whether through sports training,
reading, or hands-on experimentation. I enjoy discovering new perspectives and connecting
diverse experiences. (That said, I still haven’t found an equation to explain why coffee
always runs out too quickly.)

**About my job:**
What motivates me most is being able to bring together different realms of knowledge,
look for unexpected connections, and find concrete ways to apply knowledge in real life.
