### Mathieu Quesnel-Vallières, Ph.D.
he/him; last name pronunciation: *"ken-el val-e-air"*
#### Assistant Professor
#### Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Université de Sherbrooke
The list of biology fields that my research has involved at one point
or another is too long to post here. Let's say I know very little about
a lot of things.

**On the daily:**
If you wonder whether I'm being serious, I'm not. Music always and
everywhere. I sneeze often and loud - my apologies to those who spend
time in my general vicinity.
Leadership style: 95% Gus Fring, 5% Michael Scott

**About my job:**
Conferences are the best part of what we do as academic
researchers. You travel to meet new colleagues, start collaborations,
get updated on the state of the art, promote your work. It's the best.

**Training:**
- Postdoc, University of Pennsylvania (2023)
- Ph.D., University of Toronto (2017)
- M.Sc., Université de Montréal (2010)
- B.Sc., Université de Montréal (2007)

### Emma Delannoy
#### M.Sc. student in Cell Biology
During my academic journey, I have been able to explore numerous fields,
but I have primarily worked on projects related to the regulation
of the immune system in the context of cancer.

**On the daily:**
I am quite talkative, always chatting or humming a little tune.
As for hobbies, I am a fan of traditional elderly activities,
especially embroidery and crochet.

**About my job:**
What I appreciate the most is the opportunity to evolve in a multicultural
environment and to interact with people with different backgrounds and
perspectives, making this environment even more enriching and inspiring.

PS : hide your pens, I heard someone has a little hoarding problem...

### Nassima Bouzidi
#### M.Sc. student in Cell Biology
I previously had the opportunity to explore a multitude of projects,
primarily focused on gene therapy and neurobiology. I arrive in Sherbrooke
with the determination to concretize my professional aspirations by fully
investing myself in a project that is dear to my heart.

**On the daily:**
I can't help but dance, albeit poorly, every time I listen to music, and I listen
to a lot of it... I'm learning to understand the local language. You can often find
me with my notebook where I collect the Quebec expressions I hear for the first time.

**About my job:**
I love, and have always loved, working in research, a world where we have the
pleasure to interact daily with passionate collaborators from all corners of the world,
from whom we learn a lot about science and the world.

### Léo Eusebi
#### M.Sc. student in Cell Biology

I originally started my academic career in biology due to my love for animals and plants
but eventually branched out towards bioinformatics and medicine. I discovered that as
long as there is a hint of biology in the field I’ll be able to find passion and
strength to fully throw myself in the topic. My master thesis revolved around colorectal
cancer and metabolic modelling. 

**On the daily:**
I am extremely curious and I love to dig into different kinds of hobbies such as
crochet, hiking, drawing, music, cooking, plant parenting, dance, gaming, etc.
(jack-of-all-trade pretty much, eh?). On a side note, I am also a homebody who loves
cats, although squirrels are starting to grow on me.

**About my job:**
I very much enjoy socialising with people from different backgrounds as I believe
such interactions always provide useful insights. Concerning my research, cancer
is something I find really fascinating and always crave to learn more about.
