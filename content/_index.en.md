### Interrogating the RNA to find new cancer treatments
Our lab uses high-throughput sequencing data and experimental validations
to find RNA variations involved in normal tissue development or in cancer.

Using variations in RNA splicing patterns, it is possible to discover molecular
signals missed with other approaches. Over the years, transcriptomic analyses
have provided key insight on questions encompassing the fields of
autism spectrum disorders and cancer. For example:
&nbsp;
- Survey of all alternative splicing events occuring in 86 normal human tissues
and 41 cancer datesets - see [Quesnel-Vallières et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1043)  
- Discovery of molecular patterns shared by a large array of tumor types and
characterized by the deregulation of RNA processing - see [Jha, Quesnel-Vallières et al. 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02681-3)  
- Description of a program of alternative RNA splicing events causally linked to a large
fraction of autism spectrum disorder cases - see [Irimia et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414015128?via%3Dihub), [Quesnel-Vallières et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516308061?via%3Dihub)

### Vision
The lab officially launched in September 2023. Our research is driven by a combination of
computional analyses to generate hypotheses and experimental work to describe biological
functions. **We believe that studying RNA splicing will uncover new therapeutic avenues for
cancer. We also believe that the role of RNA-binding proteins is heavily underestimated in
immune cell development and function.**
