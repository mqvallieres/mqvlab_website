### Interrogating the RNA to find new cancer treatments
Our lab uses high-throughput sequencing data and experimental validations
to find RNA variations involved in normal tissues development or in cancer.

Using variations in RNA splicing patterns, it is possible to discover molecular
signals missed with other approaches. Over the years, transcriptomic analyses
have provided key insight on questions encompassing the fields of
autism spectrum disorders and cancer. For example, transcriptomic
analyses revealed that:
&nbsp;
- A program of alternative RNA splicing events is causally linked to a large
fraction of autism spectrum disorder cases - see [Irimia et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414015128?via%3Dihub), [Quesnel-Vallières et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516308061?via%3Dihub)
- A large array of diverse tumour types share common molecular patterns
characterized by the deregulation of RNA processing - see [Jha, Quesnel-Vallières et al. 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02681-3)


### Vision
The lab will officially launch in September 2023. Our research is driven by a combination of
computional analyses to generate hypotheses and experimental work to describe biological
functions. **We believe that studying RNA splicing will uncover new therapeutic avenues for
cancer. We also believe that the role of RNA-binding proteins is heavily underestimated in
immune cell development and function.**

We actively seek [graduate students and postdocs](positions)
to pursue [projects](projects) that will open new avenues for cancer treatment and
advance our understanding of the immune system.


### Funding
The lab is supported by a Next Generation of Scientists Award from the Cancer Research
Society as well as startup funds from the Université de Sherbrooke and CRCHUS.
