### Mathieu Quesnel-Vallières, Ph.D.
he/him; last name pronunciation: *"ken-el val-e-air"*
#### Incoming Assistant Professor
#### Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Université de Sherbrooke
The list of biology fields that my research has involved at one point
or another is too long to post here. Let's say I know very little about
a lot of things. I have a hard time remembering faces and names. I have
a hard time remembering other things as well. You can take advantage by
pretending I said or agreed to something - I have to roll with it
because I wouldn't remember anyway.

**On the daily:**
If you wonder whether I'm being serious, I'm not. Music always and
everywhere. I sneeze often and loud - my apologies to those who spend
time in my general vicinity.

**Beliefs:**
Conferences are the best part of what we do as academic
researchers. You travel to meet new colleagues, start collaborations,
get updated on the state of the art, promote your work. It's the best.

**Training:**
- Postdoc, University of Pennsylvania (2023)
- Ph.D., University of Toronto (2017)
- M.Sc., Université de Montréal (2010)
- B.Sc., Université de Montréal (2007)
